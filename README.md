# SRM-PLACIFY

## The problem SRM PLACIFY solves

College life is the most precious life one experiences, we value our duties, take responsibility in completing any assigned work, and get ready to get into corporate life. One who is looking for a job must go through this on-campus placement phase which is indeed tiring so in order to reduce the tiresome days of the students, this portal helps them to gather information from seniors regarding the company, the way of preparation to crack marquee or super dream level jobs and become successful in career. 

So this portal serves the purpose of connecting to those extraordinary seniors from our college who banged top companies from India or overseas. The more advantage of this portal is that we can enquire about the problem anytime by connecting with them over the internet rather than waiting for their alumni talks. This will not only help the upcoming batches of SRM but also will lay a good foundation to get into the corporate sector by following their guidelines which in turn will also make a good bond among us. The website provides resources for profile building and resolves ways to cover complete important topics in time. The website also unravels methods to decode interviews during placement and also provides major project ideas from our experts to work on which can help in skill development.
